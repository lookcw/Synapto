Run:
java -jar OpenCSVWriter.jar 

followed by system arguments. The one system argument that you must provide is the input file path (The file path for where the input csv file lies). 

-i filepath
-o output_file.csv
-f numFolds
-s numSeeds

MUST be written in this format or it will not work (So the header followed by the argument). If you don’t specify the output file, it will be written to a csv called default.csv. If you don’t specify the number of seeds or the number of folds, they will be set to 10.

Example of what to run:

java -jar OpenCSVWriter.jar -i ../../Synapto/tensorflow/Brazil/Feature_Sets/Fil_higARmin7.csv -o data.csv -s 5

(can be written in any order as long as the header precedes the argument)
